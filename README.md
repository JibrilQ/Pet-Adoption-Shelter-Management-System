# Pet Adoption & Shelter Management System

A full-stack web application that connects animal shelters with potential adopters. Shelters have the ability to list pets up for adoption, manage applications, and track adoption pipelines, while the public can browse potential pets & submit adoption applications.

## Project Overview

This application serves two main user types with tailored interfaces:
1.  **Shelters:** Can manage their inventory of pets and process incoming adoption applications.
2.  **Adopters:** Can browse available pets and track the status of their adoption requests.

The project utilises a custom-designed UI with a **Navy & Lavender** aesthetic and modern card-based layouts.
